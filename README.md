# WordCloud
Word Cloud generator as per the frequency of words

For this project, create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script process the text, remove punctuation, 
ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.
A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from dictionary.

For the input text of your script, need to provide a file that contains text only. 
For the text itself, copy and paste the contents of a website you like. Save as a .txt file

Need to upload input file here so that script will be able to process it. To do the upload, Need an uploader widget. 
It may take a minute for all of this to run and there will be a lot of output messages. 
And Last our " WORD CLOUD "
